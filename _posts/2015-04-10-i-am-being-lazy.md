I am being lazy and always procrastinate.
I know I have to do something to fix this. I am too tired to do something that I like,
I think my body and my mind already exhausted because daily routine of work.

When arrived at home after 9-5 work, I just watch movie, listening music, youtube-ing, and fall asleep.
Tomorrow morning when on the way to work, I regret what I've done. No productive at all.

But I repeat again an again. :(

“Procrastination is my sin. It brings me naught but sorrow. I know that I should stop it. In fact, I will--tomorrow”
― Gloria Pitzer

I hope, I can change to be productive and get things done.

“Change, like healing, takes time.”
― Veronica Roth, Allegiant
